            <h5>Overview</h5>
            <h2>About This Project</h2>

            <p>
              Our team was tasked with designing a new feature(s) and/or improve
              an existing feature(s) for our assigned client(West Side German
              Shepherd Rescue -shepresue.org), to create a delightful experience
              for the persona(s) we defined through research.
            </p>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
              German shepherd lovers need a more personable and updated way to
              select an animal rescue in order to find a german shepherd to add
              to her family. One look at sheprescue.org and you can see that
              this site design is 20 years old.

            <h2>How Might We...?</h2>
            <p>
              How might we design an updated experience of sheprescue.org for
              that delivers a more personable experience for their customers?
              The challenge was to design and build a user-centered website for
              West Side German Shepherd Rescue that organized the wines in
              proper categories and provided navigation and search for the user
              to be able to easily find and purchase wines and have them
              delivered.

              We also looked at sites that are not competitor and gatehred a few

              Fantastic Redesign with Future Improvements to Come
            </h2>
            <p>
              With a complete redesign of sheprescue.org we believe that we have
              improved the user experience for their customers. The site is no
              longer outdated and is better organized. The look and feel is
              clean and with consisten colors and typography.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will continue working on the design by conducting usability
              testing.
