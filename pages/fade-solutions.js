              Fade Technology is an early-stage startup with a team of
              entertainment technology, payments, and digital leaders from
              leading companies. Fade Technology provides the quickest way to
              embed the next-generation of shoppable media on the digital
              publisher and streaming service platforms. It is a cloud-based
              platform that enables digital publishers to monetize editorial,
              sponsored, advertorial, and original video content natively. It
              allows a new e-commerce experience that lets viewers instantly
              discover and buy products directly from the video on the platform
              they are on, without redirects.

              The Fade executives and technology teams came to us with a
              detailed project brief, inclding how their system worked for
              publishers, agencies, brands and admins and examples of Facebook
              Business Suite and Snapchat's Business dashboard. We did not have
              access to user info, nor could we interview users since their
              users are their business clients.

            <Typography variant="body1">
              Fade did part of our Double Diamond work for us and we just needed
              to build on what they provided and begin with competitive and
              comparative analysis then moved to sketches and low-fidelity
              wireframing based on the examples.

            <Typography variant="body1">
              Campaign managment solutions and administrative dashboards are
              nothing new. Many companies, such as Amazon, YouTube and Facebook
              alll have those solutions for their business users. We simply
              looked at those properties and features and applied it to Fades
              project brief.

            <Typography variant="body1">
              Fades business model is an advertiser driven B2B model not for
              consumers, so we focused heavily on their layout and UI components
              including analytics. Fade has no direct competitors based on their
              unique offering.

              Fades proposition is a unique technology and although there are
              similarites in the online ad space they do not have a direct
              competitor. We next looked at Amazon's Seller Central's dashboard.
              Their business model is not an advertishing based model but there
              are similarities in their solutions. This was to gather more data
              on how these solutions are designed, and to get more inspiration.

              We began our process by sketching low fidelity wireframes with pen
              and paper. Since the brief informed us of what the dashboard
              should look like, based on the examples provided, and the fact
              that we had no ability to do user research with participants, we
              just started sketching. The results were that we got early buyin
              from the client and we could procede to site-mapping and
              mid-fidelity wireframing.

              Finally, we conducted qualitative usability testing sessions with
              our clients to identify problems in our prototype, uncover
              opportunities and to discover users' behaviors and preferences. We
              worked from user testing scripts and guided our users to perform
              specific tasks. We conducted our sessions via Zoom and recorded
              the sessions.

              Dashboards are a challenging undertaking due to the
              data-visulization features and figuring out the best user
              experience for those components. In this particualr project we had
              to rely on the brief which gave us a lot of information to begin
              designing our solution and we were then able to validate our
              assumptions by usability-testing.
